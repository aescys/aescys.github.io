# main
work on the bottom edge where main meets footer and how the overlay between main and .content_backdrop looks

# content_div
tweak the content_div enlarging feature. Id like it to work so that when unenlarged, the content that would be in the article is confined to the dimensions of the content div, and that when clicked the content div height expands to display the article in full, until clicked again

# footer
figure out how to make it display the same as the main element, same width

give it its own version of .content_backdrop within to match the styling of the main element

# menubar
declare a suitable conversion for the hide tab bar feature on mobile devices
