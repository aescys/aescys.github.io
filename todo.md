# <span style="color: lightblue">Site-Wide</span>

possibly use seperate css files for each page, cdude or code may require special ones due to their future visual display load
### main
work on the bottom edge where main meets footer and how the overlay between main and .content_backdrop looks

### content_div
tweak the content_div enlarging feature. Id like it to work so that when unenlarged, the content that would be in the article is confined to the dimensions of the content div, and that when clicked the content div height expands to display the article in full, until clicked again

### footer
figure out how to make it display the same as the main element, same width

give it its own version of .content_backdrop within to match the styling of the main element

### menubar
declare a suitable conversion for the hide tab bar feature on mobile devices

# <span style="color: maroon">Index</span>

# <span style="color: green">Code</span>
 begin carving out a format for the function displays to follow, practice with Mouse Tracker
 ### Key Points
  - Contain a live visual demonstration of the function being displayed
  - Contain a brief description of the function and what is does
  - Include a clickable link that will open the source code for said function, possibly even a download link

# <span style="color: purple">Cdude</span>
 - experiment with using buttons to create the tab system for the comical dude version selectors, this could possibly decrease the complexity of the site wide titlebar
 - implement the comic version selectors fully so that clicking on one selector or another shows the respective comic
    - do so without creating seperate pages for each comic
