# <span style="color: lightblue">Site-Wide</span>

 possibly use seperate css files for each page, cdude or code may require special ones due to their future visual display load
### main
 work on the bottom edge where main meets footer and how the overlay between main and .content_backdrop looks

### content_div
 tweak the content_div enlarging feature. Id like it to work so that when unenlarged, the content that would be in the article is confined to the dimensions of the content div, and that when clicked the content div height expands to display the article in full, until clicked again

 for some reason if the content is long enough to be scrollable, the top line of the div only displays when the div enlarges. See intro div on index.html

### footer
 figure out how to make it display the same as the main element, same width

 give it its own version of .content_backdrop within to match the styling of the main element

### menubar
 declare a suitable conversion for the hide tab bar feature on mobile devices

 add a feature that shrinks the menubar when the page is scrolled down, but keeps the menubar fixed and visible still

 fix up the design, the dynamic sizing is totally off, and a pain, I know

# <span style="color: maroon">Index</span>

# <span style="color: green">Code</span>
 begin carving out a format for the function displays to follow, practice with Mouse Tracker
 ### Key Points
  - Contain a live visual demonstration of the function being displayed
  - Contain a brief description of the function and what is does
  - Include a clickable link that will open the source code for said function, possibly even a download link

# <span style="color: blue">Math</span>

# <span style="color: purple">Cdude</span>
 - experiment with using buttons to create the tab system for the comical dude version selectors, this could possibly decrease the complexity of the site wide titlebar
 - implement the comic version selectors fully so that clicking on one selector or another shows the respective comic
    - do so without creating seperate pages for each comic

 - gear up Mk1 for launch, f it we ball dude 0o0, 
    - add a references list at the end of the document, then, upload it. Put it in da folder.
